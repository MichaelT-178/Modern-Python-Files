# Modern-Python-Files
These are more modern python files I've created.

### What these files do
- Install_yt-dlp is to help with the [youtube downloader](https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl) installation process. 
- YT_downloader_helper is a command-line interface tool that I built to simplify the process of downloading YouTube videos and extracting certain parts from them.
- NameStatsUPDATED is a more cleanly written version of the original [NameStats](https://github.com/MichaelT-178/Ancient-Python-Files/blob/main/NameStats.py) program in the Ancient-Python-Files repository.
- og_main_algorithm.py is the original main algorithm I used for the Livestream Directory. I've since rewritten the algorithm in Java
to make it faster and more organized.
