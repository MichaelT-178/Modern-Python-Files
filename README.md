# Modern-Python-Files
These are more modern python files I've created.

### What these files do
- <b>analyze_excel.py</b>: Reads the values from an Excel spreadsheet.

- <b>Clip_mp4.py</b>: Clips a section of an mp4 clip.

- <b>delete_sims.py</b>: Tool to help delete unused XCode simulators that are taking up space.

- <b>download_yt_songs.py</b>: Downloads videos from a YouTube playlist as mp3 files.

- <b>example.xlsx</b>: A sample Excel spreadsheet that's used in the read_excel.py program.

- <b>flash_drive_controller.py</b>: A program to help you easily perform various tasks with a flash drive.

- <b>Get_YT_Playlist</b>: A program that downloads every video from from a youtube playlist.

- <b>install_yt-dlp</b>: A program to help with the [youtube downloader](https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl) installation process. 

- <b>NameStatsUPDATED</b>: A more cleanly written version of the original [NameStats](https://github.com/MichaelT-178/Ancient-Python-Files/blob/main/NameStats.py) program that I made my when I started coding. The original can be found in the Ancient-Python-Files repository.

- <b>og_main_algorithm.py</b>: This is the original main algorithm I used for the Livestream Directory. After Corey stopped live streaming I rewrote it in C# to add new features, make it more organized, try out a new language, etc.

- <b>read_excel.py</b>: Read's the data of an excel spreadsheet.

- <b>read_file.py</b>: Super simple file for whenever I need to read a txt file.

- <b>read.txt</b>: is the txt file that read_file.py uses.

- <b>rescale_image.py</b>: Rescales and saves an image. 

- <b>send_email.py</b>: Used to send an email using python.

- <b>TikTok_Downloader.py</b>: A [tiktok-downloader](https://github.com/n0l3r/tiktok-downloader) wrapper that I created to help make downloading TikTok videos easier, faster, and less complicated. Fetches the website link, pastes it to your clipboard, allows you to rename the TikTok file, and then saves it to the correct directory.

- <b>videos.json</b>: This is just an output file from the Get_YT_Playlist.py file. Basically how it works is the python program gets all the links, titles, and lengths of the videos from a youtube playlist, then writes the info to a JSON file. The user then goes to the json file and can decide to only download certain intervals of the videos and can change the titles of the videos that will be saved.

- <b>YT_downloader_helper</b> A CLI wrapper tool that I built to simplify the process of downloading YouTube videos and clipping them.
