# Modern-Python-Files
These are more modern python files I've created.

### What these files do
- analyze_excel Reads in values from Excel spreadsheet.

- Clip_mp4.py clips a mp4 clip using ffmpeg and python. 

- download_yt_songs.py downloads a playlist of youtube videos as mp3 files

- example.xlsx is a sample Excel sheet that's used in the read_excel.py program.

- flash_drive.py is a Flash Drive Controller program to peform various tasks using a flash drive.

- Get_YT_Playlist downloads every video from from a youtube playlist.

- install_yt-dlp is to help with the [youtube downloader](https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl) installation process. 

- NameStatsUPDATED is a more cleanly written version of the original [NameStats](https://github.com/MichaelT-178/Ancient-Python-Files/blob/main/NameStats.py) program in the Ancient-Python-Files repository.

- og_main_algorithm.py is the original main algorithm I previously used for the Livestream Directory. I've since rewritten the algorithm in Java to make it faster and more organized.

- read_excel.py is a simple template to read data from an excel worksheet

- read_file.py is a simple program for whenever I need to read a txt file.

- read.txt is the txt file that read_file.py uses.

- rescale_image.py rescales and saves an image. 

- send_email.py Used to send an email using python.

- TikTok_Downloader.py is used to make using the [tiktok-downloader](https://github.com/n0l3r/tiktok-downloader) faster and easier. Fetches the website link, pastes it to your clipboard, allows you to rename the TikTok file, and saves it to the correct directory.

- videos.json is an output file from the Get_YT_Playlist.py file. Basically how it works is the python program gets all the links, titles, and lengths of videos from a youtube playlist then writes the info to a JSON file. The user then goes to the json file and can decide to only download certain interval of the video and change the title of the video that will be saved.

- YT_downloader_helper is a command-line interface tool that I built to simplify the process of downloading YouTube videos and extracting certain parts from them.
