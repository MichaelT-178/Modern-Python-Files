# Modern-Python-Files
These are more modern python files I've created.

•Install_yt-dlp is to help with the youtube downloader installation process. 
•YT_downloader_helper is a command line interface tool I built to help make downloading youtube and certain parts of the video easier.
•NameStatsUPDATED is a more cleanly written version of the original NameStats program in the Ancient-Python-Files repository.
•og_main_algorithm.py is the original main algorithm I used for the Livestream Directory. I've rewritten the algorithm in Java
to make it faster, more organized, and I've made it more well documented.
